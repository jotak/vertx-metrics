= Prometheus Metrics

This project is an implementation of the Vert.x Metrics Service Provider Interface (SPI): metrics built from Vert.x
events are available for https://prometheus.io/[Prometheus] scraper.

== Features

* Vert.x core tools monitoring: TCP/HTTP client and servers, `link:../../apidocs/io/vertx/core/datagram/DatagramSocket.html[DatagramSocket]`,
`link:../../apidocs/io/vertx/core/eventbus/EventBus.html[EventBus]` and handlers
* User defined metrics can be added to the shared registry (using Prometheus https://github.com/prometheus/client_java[simple Java client])

== Prerequisites

Follow the https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/getting_started/[instructions to get Prometheus up and running].

== Getting started

The _vertx-prometheus-metrics_ module must be present in the classpath.

Maven users should add this to their project POM file:

[source,xml,subs="+attributes"]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.vertx</groupId>
  <artifactId>vertx-prometheus-metrics</artifactId>
  <version>3.5.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
----

And Gradle users, to their build file:

[source,groovy,subs="+attributes"]
----
compile 'io.vertx:vertx-prometheus-metrics:3.5.0-SNAPSHOT'
----

Vert.x does not enable SPI implementations by default. You must enable metric collection in the Vert.x options:

[source,kotlin]
----
var vertx = Vertx.vertx(VertxOptions(
  metricsOptions = VertxPrometheusOptions(
    enabled = true)))

----

== Configuration

=== Using an embedded HTTP server for exposing endpoints

[source,kotlin]
----
Code not translatable
----

=== Binding an existing Vert.X router

[source,kotlin]
----
var vertx = Vertx.vertx(VertxOptions(
  metricsOptions = VertxPrometheusOptions(
    enabled = true)))

// Later on, creating a router
var router = Router.router(vertx)
router.route("/custom").handler(io.vertx.ext.prometheus.impl.PrometheusVertxMetrics.createMetricsHandler())

----

Please refer to `link:../../apidocs/io/vertx/ext/prometheus/VertxPrometheusOptions.html[VertxPrometheusOptions]` for an exhaustive list of options.

This section lists all the metrics generated by monitoring Vert.x pools.

There are two types currently supported:
